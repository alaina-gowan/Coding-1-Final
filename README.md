# Alaina Gowan's Coding 1 Final
This website was created for my Coding 1 Final from starter files provided by the teacher.

## About the Site
I designed this website as if it were a fanclub site for SKZOO (K-pop group Stray Kids' cartoon animal counterparts).
### Index
My index page has a carousel, which was included in the starter files. I changed the images in the carousel to images of official SKZOO art.
### "About" Page
My about page contains a brief description of myself as well as a brief description of what the website's purpose would be. Though the website is not actually a fanclub site and I do not actually run a fanclub, I made sure to include information about myself that is as true as possible.
### "Contact" Page
The contact page of my website includes my name and placeholders for phone number, email, and address. (They are placeholders for safety reasons.) I also added Font Awesome Icons to this page which link to social media. I did not link Facebook or Twitter to accounts, but Instagram and Last.fm are both linked to my own accounts.
